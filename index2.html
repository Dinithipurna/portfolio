            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning to develop 
                solutions that enhance human decision-making and improve user experiences. My current PhD research focuses on 
                Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Virtual Reality (VR). As a self-motivated learner, I thrive on exploring 
                emerging technologies and interdisciplinary approaches. I enjoy collaborating across fields to push the boundaries 
                of AI-driven insights into human experiences and advancing the understanding of human behavior.</p>
            <!-- <p>With a background in **Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering** (University of Moratuwa, **First-Class Honors**), I specialize in **AI-driven decision-making, explainable AI, and user interaction analysis**.</p> -->
