                    <div class="project-content">
                        <p>VRsense is an explainable system developed to help VR game developers assess 
                            cybersickness in their games. Unlike traditional black-box approaches, our system 
                            utilizes engineered features to provide actionable insights into game design and user interactions. 
                            Designed to be plug-and-play, VRSense allows any VR game developer to upload their data or run 
                            VRHook on their gameplay, receiving valuable feedback on how effectively their game tackles
                             motion sickness.</p>

                    <img src="assets/FYP2.png" alt="Project Image" class="project-image">
                    <div class="project-content">
                        <p>We developed a novel, state-of-the-art 3D-2D correspondence technique to enhance the understanding 
                            of 3D point clouds. Additionally, we created a 3D vision algorithm that allows users to add, delete, 
                            or modify parts of 3D objects, enabling the regeneration of transformed objects on the other end. 
                            Our solution was rigorously evaluated against a series of simulated privacy attacks. To assess its 
                            real-world applicability, we implemented the algorithm on a smart device, testing its practicality 
                            for deployment in Mixed Reality environments. This is the Final Year Project of my Undergraduate Studies.</p>

                        <p>The study explored how generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, contribute to value co-creation and 
                            examined how the attitudes and impressions of non-technical users influence their adoption of such 
                            technologies. This re- search aimed to understand how non-technical users interact with and respond 
                            to the current generative AI hype in the domain of primary school education. Interviewed teachers and 
                            developers centered around the adoption of a genAI-based education tool named Yuni/Hopu.</p>
